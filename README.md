# Credit_Card_Transaction_Dashboard
PowerBI dashboard
Project Objective : This project is to analyze and visualize credit card customer data using Power BI to uncover meaningful insights about customer behavior, spending patterns, and credit usage. This end-to-end project includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization with interactive dashboards and custom DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) queries. The goal is to support data-driven decision-making for financial services by identifying trends, potential risks, and customer segmentation strategies. The final report is published using Power BI and hosted here on GitHub for easy access and demonstration.
